# 🕸️ Automated Portal Login & Web Scraping using Selenium

This project combines the power of Selenium for automating the login process with advanced web scraping capabilities. It demonstrates logging into a secure portal, navigating the user interface, and extracting data for further processing.

## ✨ Features:
- 🔑 **Automated Login**: Uses Selenium to input credentials and log into a web portal.
- 📊 **Web Scraping**: Extracts data from a dynamically loaded table after login.
- 💾 **Data Export**: Processes scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame and exports it to CSV format.
- ⏳ **Intelligent Waiting**: Implements WebDriver's wait functionality to ensure smooth interaction with web elements.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack:
- **Python**
- **Selenium WebDriver**
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based)**

## 🚀 Future Enhancements:
- 🌐 **Multi-Page Scraping**: Automate navigation through multiple pages for larger datasets.
- 🔄 **API Integration**: Combine scraping with APIs to enrich the data.
- 📦 **Modularization**: Break down the scraper into smaller, reusable components.

## 🎯 How to Run:
1. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install selenium pandas
    ```
2. Download the latest Edge WebDriver and place it in your system path.
3. Update the credentials in the script and run the automation.

## 👀 Key Highlights:
- **Automation + Web Scraping**: Demonstrates skills in both login automation and data scraping.
- **Data Processing**: Includes post-processing of data into CSV format, showcasing expertise in handling data.
